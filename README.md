## ðŸ’¾ How to install

Clone and install repository and then take branch task-3-crud-api

```
git clone https://github.com/TheLevius/node-crud-api.git

cd node-crud-api

git checkout task-3-crud-api

```

Install the best and fastest package manager for Node.js "pnpm" instead "npm" globally

```

pnpm install // npm install

```

Change name of file example.env to .env;
This file contain default port number for server or load-balancer if it multi-process mode

```

PORT=4000

```

## ðŸš€ How to run

Run the application in development mode

```

pnpm start:dev // npm run start:dev

```

Run the application in production mode

```

pnpm start:prod // npm run start:prod

```

Run tests scenarios for API

```

pnpm test // npm run test

```

Run cluster mode with default load balancer and one in-memory-database for all workers

```

pnpm start:multi // npm run start:multi

```

In response you can watch which worker who response in this time on the request. Workers should round-robin and data from database should be consistent for all workers.
